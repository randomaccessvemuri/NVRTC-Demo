# NVRTC demo

NVRTC is a runtime compilation library for CUDA C++. It accepts CUDA C++ source code in character string form and creates handles that can be used to obtain the PTX.
This project demonstrates the working of the same by taking the iteration function for the Mandelbrot set and generating the image at runtime.
